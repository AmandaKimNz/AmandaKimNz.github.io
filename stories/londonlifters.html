            <p>CHARACTERS</p>

            <p><b>PHONEBILL</b></p>

            <p>The self-proclaimed leader of the criminal group ‘The London Lifters’. Self centered and eccentric, with a flair for showmanship and a love for all things evil. Despite what she says, this is only her first robbery. Has an English accent, and is 35 years old.</p>

            <p><b>MATCHBOX</b></p>

            <p>Big, strong, and a bit dim. Surprisingly nice for a criminal. Normally likes to keep his head down and follow orders, but will raise a fuss if he knows he’s being cheated. Which isn’t often. Has a slow, deep voice. Doesn’t know how old he is, but he looks about 50.</p>

            <p><b>TRASHBIN</b></p>

            <p>Small and weedy build. He’s often grumpy, and has a low tolerance for mucking around. Only created the London Lifters (name not his idea) out of desperation, distancing himself from those other ‘true’ criminals. Has a typical Chicago gangster accent. He’s 42, but turns 43 next Tuesday.</p>

            <p><b>SETTING</b></p>
            <p>Mid 1930’s, London. Scene takes place in a secret hideout, belonging to the three criminals. They arrive at their hideout, just after having robbed a bank for a million pounds.</p>

            <p><b>COSTUME</b></p>

            <p>They all wear ski masks (they just got out of a robbery!) Phonebill has a smooth, strangely colourful suit and bright red shoes. Everything she wears glitters somehow. Matchbox has a scruffy green shirt, torn brown shorts, and a tattered scarf. He’s also barefoot. Trashbin wears a plain red shirt, black pants, and a black coat.</p>

            <hr>

            <p><b>Scene opens in a room. A round table is placed in the center, with three chairs. Sheets of paper sit in a pile on the floor. A couch is off to the side. A small shelf with a rotary phone on it sits near the couch, to the couch’s left.</b></p>

            <p><b>Phonebill, Matchbox, and Trashbin enter stage right. Matchbox is carrying a large sack of money. He throws himself onto the couch, dumping the money bag on the table as he moves past it. Trashbin sits at the table, wiping his forehead with a handkerchief. Phonebill hugs the bag, still standing up.</b></p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: And a clean getaway! [<b>lets go of bag</b>] One million pounds in the bag, and the pigs have no idea where we are! Give it up for the mysterious leader of the London Lifters: Phonebill!</p>

            <p><b>Phonebill takes a bow. Matchbox claps enthusiastically.</b></p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: And how could she have made her grand heist without [<b>puts finger and thumb together</b>] a teensy bit of help from the big brute: Matchbox!</p>

            <p><b>Matchbox starts clapping. He realises that he’s Matchbox, and bows. Trashbin puts his handkerchief away and crosses his arms.</b></p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: [<b>grumpy</b>] I still object to our code-names.</p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: [<b>waves hand to Trashbin dismissively</b>] Shut up, Trashbin. You’re a part of the London Lifters now. It’s how we do things here.</p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: [<b>stands up</b>] There is no [<b>bunny ears</b>] ‘London Lifters’. I was desperate for a little cash, and [<b>points between the two</b>] got you two knuckleheads together for one week. We’re never doin’ this again.</p>

            <p>MATCHBOX: [<b>raises hand</b>] Why are we called the London Lifters at all? Wouldn’t they just call us thieves and be done with it?</p>

            <p><b>Trashbin sits down. Phonebill walks towards Matchbox.</b></p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: Oh, please, Matchbox. Those measly gas station stickups are performed by ‘just thieves’. [<b>points to bag</b>] We just took a million bucks from the top bank in all of England! Of course they’re gonna give us a name.</p>

            <p><b>Phonebill holds her hands together, near her head.</b></p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: [<b>dreamily</b>] Can you imagine the press tomorrow? [<b>slowly moves hand across the air</b>] My face, across all the papers, [<b>suddenly clench fist</b>] eaten up by the pathetic masses!</p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: [<b>hand on cheek, under his breath</b>] You mean your face that was buried under a ski mask the whole time?</p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: [<b>didn’t hear him</b>] Excuse me?</p>

            <p><b>Trashbin holds hands at chest height.</b></p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: Forget it, forget it. [<b>gets up</b>] Let’s just collect our debts and be done with it already.</p>

            <p><b>Phonebill shrugs and leads Matchbox over to the money bag. She opens it. Matchbox and Trashbin gather around, standing to either side of her.</b></p>

            <p>MATCHBOX: [<b>tearing up</b>] It’s even more beautiful up close…</p>

            <p><b>Trashbin pulls the money bag closer to himself.</b></p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: So, accordings to our agreement, [<b>points</b>] Matchbox gets two hundred thousand…</p>

            <p><b>Matchbox excitedly nods.</b></p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: [<b>points</b>] … Phonebill gets three hundred thousand…</p>

            <p><b>Phonebill looks at Matchbox, smug. Matchbox looks confused.</b></p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: [<b>hand on chest</b>] … And I get what’s left. Then we part ways, and [<b>glares at Phonebill, emphasise</b>] never see each other again.</p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: Come on, Trashbin. I’ve already planned our next outing. [<b>pulls Trashbin closer</b>] I can see the headlines already: [<b>moving hand across the air</b>] ‘The London Lifters take on America, by literally taking America!’</p>

            <p>MATCHBOX: Huh?</p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: [<b>hand down, look at Matchbox</b>] We’re gonna steal America.</p>

            <p><b>Trashbin breaks free.</b></p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: That’s-! Ugh. Look here, see. [<b>thrust finger</b>] You can go on whatever crazy adventures you like. Heck, you can drag meathead along too. I won’t spill the beans or nothin’. But I’m not comin’ with. [puts hand on the money bag] I gots what I came for. I’m done. Any more questions?</p>

            <p><b>Matchbox raises his hand.</b></p>

            <p>MATCHBOX: Why is Phonebill getting more money than me?</p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: [<b>thumb to chest, face Matchbox</b>] ‘Cause I did the most work, remember? [<b>holds up one finger</b>] I got us those guns, [<b>two fingers</b>] and chased off those guards, [<b>three</b>] and drove the car. [<b>hand to chest</b>] So I get the bigger split.</p>

            <p>MATCHBOX: [<b>satisfied</b>] Ok. [<b>pause, confused expression</b>] But, if you did the most work, why is Trashbin getting more money than you?</p>

            <p><b>Trashbin looks at Matchbox, a bit worried.</b></p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: [<b>slightly slouch</b>] What?</p>

            <p>MATCHBOX: I get two hundred grand, and you get three hundred grand. That leaves, like, at least four hundred grand.</p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: [<b>stroking her chin</b>] Yeah… Yeah! [<b>faces Trashbin</b>] What’s up with that?</p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: [<b>pulls bag away from Phonebill, glaring at her</b>] You knows I did most of the work.</p>

            <p>MATCHBOX: [<b>leans towards Trashbin, palm on table</b>] Like what?</p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: [<b>angry</b>] I dunno, recreatin’ the blueprints to the bank from scratch? Studyin’ the guard times to find our best moment? Makin’ the very plan you two were followin’ the whole time?</p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: Oh, please.</p>

            <p><b>Phonebill moves around Trashbin and the table, ending up in front of the table, facing the audience. She doesn’t face either of them as she speaks.</b></p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: The plan was good, but what’s a plan without [<b>hand near chest</b>] someone to enact it? Bring it to life?</p>

            <p><b>Trashbin stomps towards Phonebill, ending up on her left. She smiles a bit, knowing she’s angered him, then turns to face him.</b></p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: Don’t write me off that easily. It took weeks of careful observation to find even [<b>lean towards her threateningly, finger and thumb touching</b>] half of the stuff I showed you knuckleheads. You just [<b>gesture to audience</b>] waltzed in for an hour, then drove away with the dough.</p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: But that takes more skill than [<b>leans towards him more threateningly</b>] watching some guards use the bathroom all week.</p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: Was it now?</p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: [<b>lean back with mocking shock, hand on chest</b>] You weren’t the one screaming your lungs out half an hour ago! [<b>thumb to Matchbox</b>] Even Matchbox did more work than you.</p>

            <p>MATCHBOX: [<b>thoughtful</b>] Yeah! [<b>walks towards the others, holding thumb to self</b>] I should get the biggest cut!</p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: [<b>steps away from Matchbox, open palms up</b>] Now, let’s not get ahead of ourselves.</p>

            <p>MATCHBOX: [<b>to Phonebill</b>] No. I’m the one that had to carry the money all this way. [<b>pretend to flail gun</b>] While I was waving me gun around at those other people!</p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: [<b>patronising</b>] Oh, it was so hard to carry a bag around, was it?</p>

            <p>MATCHBOX: [<b>face Trashbin, point to bag</b>] That thing’s like a million pounds!</p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: [<b>to Trashbin</b>] At any rate, [<b>sits on table</b>] what would you need half a million pounds for?</p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: [<b>folds arms</b>] Ain’t it obvious? To spend it.</p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: But you said earlier that you were [<b>dumb voice</b>] ‘desperate for a little cash’. I dunno what world you live in, but where I’m from ‘a little cash’ doesn’t mean [<b>emphasise</b>] ‘half a million pounds’!</p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: [<b>snaps fingers</b>] Look here. My personal life doesn’t matter to the likes o’ you. [<b>steps towards her</b>] We agreed to keep our lives secret from each other. Remember?</p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: [<b>gets off the table and steps forward, pushing him towards couch</b>] You can’t just run off with my rightful share of the dough and not say anything!</p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: Oh? Then why do you needs it?</p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: [<b>rolls eyes</b>] To buy more weapons. Obviously.</p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: Can’t ya just go rob another bank for that? Since you were so insistent on creating that [<b>bunny ears</b>] ‘London Laughers’ or whatever.</p>

            <p>MATCHBOX: [<b>raises hand</b>] Wait, I thought we were called the London Lifters.</p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: I was makin’ fun of ya, you big oaf!</p>

            <p>MATCHBOX: [<b>unfazed</b>] But laughing is good. So wouldn’t the London Laughers be a good thing?</p>

            <p><b>Trashbin smashes his fists into the table, his back to the audience. Matchbox walks forward, concerned, and Phonebill steps back in surprise. Trashbin takes a deep breath and turns to Matchbox, still leaning on the table.</b></p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: Look. I’ll tells ya why I need the money. If you two swear that you’ll [<b>points to Matchbox’s mouth</b>] shut your big gobs about me when the cops eventually find ya.</p>

            <p>MATCHBOX: I swear!</p>

            <p><b>Phonebill throws herself on the couch. One arm reaches over the back cushion.</b></p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: [<b>softly laughing</b>] We just robbed a bank, Trashbin. Why wouldn’t you trust us?</p>

            <p><b>Trashbin rubs his forehead. Matchbox leans in curiously. Pause, then Trashbin steps away from the table and towards the audience, leaving his back to the other two. His hands are behind his back.</b></p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: It’s about my kids.</p>

            <p>MATCHBOX: Kids?</p>

            <p><b>Trashbin turns to Matchbox and stomps the ground. He points to his own ears.</b></p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: Wash ya ears out, pig breath! [<b>drop arm</b>] Kids! Twins. [<b>face audience again</b>] I’m tryin’ to send ‘em off to college. I gathered up all the money I could legitimately, but I was still half a million short.</p>

            <p>MATCHBOX: [<b>moves to Trashbin, puts hand on his shoulder</b>] It can’t cost that much, can it?</p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: [<b>face Matchbox</b>] You have no idea how high college tuition is these days. [<b>under breath</b>] And I’m not surprised about that.</p>

            <p><b>Phonebill takes her arm from around the couch and leans towards the other two, hand on chin. She smirks.</b></p>

            <p>MATCHBOX: Well why not just… [<b>shrug</b>] Not send ‘em off?</p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: I can’t do that. They deserve [<b>finger straight up</b>] nothin’ short of the best!</p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: [<b>smiling</b>] … And you would do anything for these children of yours, would you?</p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: [<b>cautiously face Phonebill, trying to hide fear</b>] Yeah, what’s it to you?</p>

            <p><b>Phonebill stands up and walks towards Trashbin.</b></p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: Nothing, nothing. I’m just thinking, wouldn’t it be strange if someone were to, say, kidnap these children?</p>

            <p><b>Trashbin tenses up and steps back (away from audience and Phonebill). His expression is the same. Matchbox moves away as well, concerned.</b></p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: Hold them at a ransom of about, I don’t know, [<b>lean in</b>] the amount of dough you stole from me?</p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: You couldn’t…</p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: [<b>evil smile, nod</b>] Oh, I would!</p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: No, I says you couldn’t. [<b>motion to Phonebill</b>] You don’t know my children. You guys don’t even know my real name!</p>

            <p>MATCHBOX: [<b>small chuckle</b>] Sure we do. Trashbin.</p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: You amaze me sometimes, you know that?</p>

            <p>MATCHBOX: [<b>rub back of head</b>] Aw, shucks!</p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: We’re getting off track! [<b>move to table, pull bag closer</b>] I deserve the cash!</p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: You’re the one who was about ta hold my kids at ransom!</p>

            <p><b>Phonebill walks backwards away from the table and puts her hands to her face in sarcastic shock.</b></p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: Oh, no, did I almost engage in illegal activity? Oh, who would do such a thing?</p>

            <p><b>Matchbox looks at the money bag, then back at the other two.</b></p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: [<b>to Phonebill</b>] Don’t test me, fleabrain!</p>

            <p><b>Matchbox silently and slowly takes the money bag, and tries to sneak away as the other two talk.</b></p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: Fleabrain?</p>

            <p><b>Trashbin walks up to Phonebill aggressively. She walks away, backwards.</b></p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: You heard me. Fleabrain. Stay away from my money, stay away from my kids, and-</p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: [<b>to Matchbox</b>] Where do you think you’re going?</p>

            <p><b>Matchbox freezes, then turns, still holding the money bag. Trashbin turns to see him.</b></p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: [<b>two steps forward</b>] Oh, you thinks you can pull a fast one over me, eh?</p>

            <p>MATCHBOX: [<b>guilty</b>] I thought I was being quite slow, actually.</p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: And why are you making off with the entire million pounds, might I ask?</p>

            <p>MATCHBOX: I-I was…[<b>more confident</b>] Just looking after it. Is that a problem?</p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: Yes that’s a problem! You were about to steal it!</p>

            <p>MATCHBOX: [<b>shrug, nervous</b>] Well we already stole it once. What difference would it make?</p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: [<b>walks towards Matchbox</b>] That was different. We were stealing from a bank, [<b>hand on his shoulder</b>] as a team. You’re stealing from your team members.</p>

            <p>MATCHBOX: Well then why don’t we just split it evenly? [<b>shrugs off Phonebill’s hand</b>] If we’re a team?</p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: Because I deserve more!</p>

            <p>MATCHBOX: Why?</p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: [<b>condescending</b>] ‘Cause I’m better than you!</p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: [<b>pretends to clean ear with pinky</b>] Not sure if you had your ears open earlier, about my kids.</p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: Of course I was listening, I threatened to kidnap them! What do they matter?</p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: [<b>more aggressively</b>] It means I’m the only one that actually needs the extra cash!</p>

            <p>MATCHBOX: But I do as well!</p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: What, for your kindergarten tuition?</p>

            <p>MATCHBOX: For a house! [<b>beat</b>] I just want a home. Nothing big.</p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: [<b>curious</b>] … You don’t have a house?</p>

            <p><b>Matchbox drops the money bag on the table and sits down. He looks depressingly at the table.</b></p>

            <p>MATCHBOX: Never had one. I’ve been moving from dumpster to dumpster my whole life. [<b>looks at the others</b>] I just want a simple house, even a single room to call my own. [<b>lightly slam table, stand up</b>] But the prices have gone up, I tell you. And I can’t make any money on me own. That’s why I need all I can get.</p>

            <p><b>Short pause. Phonebill and Trashbin look at him sympathetically.</b></p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: Well, I suppose-</p>

            <p>MATCHBOX: [<b>continuing, folds arms</b>] I need it more than some dumb kids, at least.</p>

            <p><b>Trashbin pulls a handgun out of his pocket and shoots Matchbox, using one hand. Matchbox screams and drops to his knees.</b></p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: Jesus, Trashbin! [<b>point at gun</b>] You’re supposed to use both arms when firing that thing!</p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: What?</p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: If you only use one arm it can dislocate your shoulder. [<b>folds arms</b>] Do it properly next time.</p>

            <p><b>Trashbin shoots Matchbox with both arms. He’s still alive, but falls to the floor in pain.</b></p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: Jesus, Trashbin! [<b>runs over and holds Trashbin’s arms down</b>] Stop shooting him!</p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: [<b>pulls free of her grip</b>] He was stealin’ our cash. Even your split!</p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: You can’t just go around shooting people for that!</p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: It was in self defence!</p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: He wasn’t hurting anyone!</p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: He was hurtin’ my kids’ chance at success!</p>

            <p>MATCHBOX: Help…</p>

            <p><b>Phonebill helps Matchbox to his feet, with considerable effort, and guides him to the couch. Trashbin moves towards the audience as he steps out of the way.</b></p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: [<b>to Trashbin as they’re moving</b>] Look what you did!</p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: Hey, I’m in the right here! [<b>pockets gun</b>] It’s my legal right to defend myself when people try and take from me.</p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: As if Matchbox was posing enough of a threat for you to shoot him!</p>

            <p>TRASHBIN: I am, I tell ya!</p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: Oh, you’re so sure about that, huh? [<b>walks over to phone</b>] Well why don’t we find out?</p>

            <p><b>Trashbin leans his arm on one of the nearby chairs, frustrated. Phonebill angrily dials someone. They pick up.</b></p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: [<b>facing audience, talking to phone</b>] Hi, my crew and I were wondering about the extent of self defence. [<b>pause</b>] You see, one of us was about to take the million pounds for himself, when we all- [<b>pause</b>] Yes, a million pounds.</p>

            <p>MATCHBOX: It hurts…</p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: [<b>to Matchbox, cover phone with other hand</b>] Will you shut up, I’m on the phone! [<b>to phone</b>] Sorry. Look, long story short, [<b>motion to Trashbin</b>] the other guy shot [<b>motion to Matchbox</b>] the first guy, and I told him that- [<b>pause</b>] Yeah? [<b>pause</b>] Yeah, of course. We’re behind the abandoned warehouse. You know, on Ratsfield Street? [<b>pause</b>] You will? Thanks.</p>

            <p><b>Phonebill hangs up.</b></p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: [<b>proud</b>] Alright, the police will be here in a couple minutes to help settle this.</p>

            <p><b>Sirens can be heard in the distance. Trashbin jumps, clearly scared and leaning away from stage right. Phonebill’s arms drop and her eyes widen.</b></p>

            <p>PHONEBILL: Everybody! Scram!</p>

            <p><b>Phonebill and Trashbin help Matchbox up and exit stage left, leaving the money bag on the table.</b></p>
