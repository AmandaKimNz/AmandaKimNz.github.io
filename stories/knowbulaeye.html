            <p>"We made it. We finally made it."</p>

            <p>A man in red armour, an elf in a green potato sack, and an ogre in a blue shirt stood in front of two massive stone doors. Painted above the doors was a golden eye with a blue pupil. The man in red, Kandoth, turned around to his two teammates.</p>

            <p>"Alright, gang. We've finally found the den of the Knowbula Eye. Before we go in and end our journey once and for all, I'd like to say that it's been an honour working with you two."</p>

            <p>"Working, Kandoth?" the elf Pomeere spoke up. "Brundo and I were working. You just stood in the sidelines telling us what to do."</p>

            <p>"... Alright, I'm not keen on you, but Brundo was a useful, not-annoying ally in our quest."</p>

            <p>The ogre grunted in response. Kandoth assumed he was happy.</p>

            <p>Pomeere snapped his fingers. "Now that our goodbyes are over, can we go ask the question? We have a village to save."</p>

            <p>Kandoth squinted at Pomeere as he pushed the doors open. Inside was nothing but a few steps leading to a giant grey eyeball. The trio walked up the stairs and stood in front of the colossal sphere.</p>

            <p>Kandoth spoke. "We are a group from the Titate Village. We've come in search of the Knowbula Eye's wisdom, if we may be allowed to hear it."</p>

            <p>After a few seconds of silence, the giant eye started to glow. Its formerly monochrome palette shifted between a variety of different colours. Red, blue, purple, brown, even some colours the group had never seen before. Colours that made them feel at peace, colours that made them feel scared, colours that no living being had seen before.</p>

            <p>Once the light show was over, it settled for the golden colour painted above the doors. Then a cheery, feminine voice came from the eye. "Hi, welcome to Knowbula! How may I help you? We have all fire-based items 10% off today!"</p>

            <p>The trio looked at each other. None of the legends had mentioned anything like this, but they knew better than to question their only hope at saving their home. Kandoth slowly inhaled and spoke to the eyeball. "We would like to ask a question."</p>

            <p>"Alrighty then! That'll be... One song on a diamond flute!"</p>

            <p>Kandoth and Brundo turned to their elven friend.</p>

            <p>"Yeah, yeah. Gimme a minute," he said, digging through his bag. He pulled out a flute made of clear diamond and started blowing into it. No sound came out, but the eye became a bit brighter while the 'song' was being played.</p>

            <p>After two and a half minutes of silence, the eye went back to its usual brightness and spoke again. "Excellent! You may now ask a single question."</p>

            <p>"Finally..." Kandoth muttered under his breath, before speaking clearly to the eye. "Knowbula, a terrible knight with indestructible armour is on his way to destroy our village in a matter of days. He calls himself Vorezno. There have been rumours that he has a single weakness, but no one on this Earth knows what it is. So our question is this: What is Vorezno's weakness?"</p>

            <p>"Your question is 'What is Vorezno's weakness?', is this correct?"</p>

            <p>"Yes."</p>

            <p>The eye waited for a moment before responding. "Alright!" it eventually replied. "Your question has been asked, and the answer will arrive in twenty-eight days!"</p>

            <p>"Augh, what?" Pomeere shouted. "I played that entire song for this?"</p>

            <p>Brundo made a strange snarling sound at Pomeere.</p>

            <p>"Hey, it's a classic! The elves at home are downright jealous I can play that!"</p>

            <p>"Knowbula Eye," Kandoth said, pretending not to notice the others, "we understand that you may be busy, but Vorezno will have arrived by then. Is there any way we can get the answer sooner?"</p>

            <p>"If you'd like to gain faster answers, we have a membership program you can sign up to!" the eye said. "It's only four squirrels per month, or forty-five a year upfront!"</p>

            <p>The group all started at the giant orb. Kandoth put a hand to his ear. "M-Membership?"</p>

            <p>"Yep! Knowbula Plus! Not only will you get sonic-speed answers to all your Knowbula questions, but also seasonal discounts, higher quality armour and weapons, ads for our other services, and much more!"</p>

            <p>"How much did you say this was?" Kandoth asked.</p>

            <p>"Four squirrels per month, or forty-five a year upfront. Whichever way you want to pay!"</p>

            <p>Kandoth turned to Pomeere. "Alright, Pomeere. Take forty-five squirrels out of the team deposit."</p>

            <p>"Don't tell me what to do!" he said, shaking his fist at the armoured human. "Why should we blow all our squirrels on this crummy thing? Why not just buy a month?"</p>

            <p>"Buying a yearâ€™s worth is cheaper than the same set of months. If we pay twelve lots of four, that'll be forty-eight by the end of the year."</p>

            <p>"But we'd only use it this month!"</p>

            <p>"But what if we want to use it later? Vorezno might not be the only threat to our village. If we ever need to use the Knowbula services later, we already know where to go."</p>

            <p>"Well, too bad, cause we only have forty-four squirrels anyway."</p>

            <p>Kandoth's eyes widened. "But we had forty-five yesterday! And we haven't bought anything since then!"</p>

            <p>"Well, I sorta ate one while you weren't looking."</p>

            <p>Kandoth glared at the elf. "Fine. I suppose that's what we get for making our currency edible. We'll pay for a month's membership."</p>

            <p>Pomeere took four squirrels out of his bag and placed them in front of the sphere. After a few seconds of nothing happening, the squirrels vanished into thin air.</p>

            <p>"Excellent!" The eye sounded pleased. "You are now an official Knowbula Plus member! Your answer will now arrive in fourteen days!"</p>

            <p>"I... Suppose that's an improvement..." Kandoth said.</p>

            <p>Brundo made a low gurgling sound.</p>

            <p>Pomeere looked at them in disbelief. "You two can be as happy as you want with this, but I think Vorezno's probably gonna arrive before then!"</p>

            <p>"You may have a point," Kandoth agreed. He turned to the eye once more. "Is there anything we can do to make it faster? Anything at all?"</p>

            <p>"Well, you can always sign up for our premium membership! On top of lightning-fast responses to your Knowbula questions, we also supply bonus seasonal discounts, personalised potions, the ability to rename your pets..."</p>

            <p>The group groaned. Despite none of them trying to hide it, the eye didn't seem to notice, as it continued on with the perks of Knowbula Platinum. "... And so much more! Only four lightning squirrels per month, or forty-five a year upfront!"</p>

            <p>"Lightning squirrels?!" Pomeere shouted at the golden ball. "You want FOUR?!"</p>

            <p>Kandoth stepped away from Pomeere. "Um, what's a lightning squirrel, exactly?"</p>

            <p>"Do they teach you nothing in human school? It's a squirrel that's been struck by lightning! Finding one is hard enough, but FOUR?! This is a rip-off!"</p>

            <p>"I assure you, the perks are worth the cost," the eye stated. "Oh, did I mention that you get access to the training club?"</p>

            <p>"I believe you did, thanks." Kandoth turned to Pomeere. "Look, it's not ideal, but it's our only shot at knowing Vorezno's weakness. Don't you know any way we can easily get lightning squirrels?"</p>

            <p>Brundo pointed a finger at himself and made a snorting sound, which caused Pomeere's pointed ears to perk up.</p>

            <p>"You know? Really?"</p>

            <p>Brundo grunted.</p>

            <p>Pomeere hopped onto his shoulder and turned back to his armoured 'friend'. "Kandoth! That lightning farmer from the Gerthud Village still owes us a favour! If we hurry, we can make it back here before sundown!"</p>

            <p>Kandoth straightened up. "Then what are we waiting for?" He exclaimed as he ran towards the doors. He grabbed the handles and pulled, but they wouldn't budge. Brundo staggered over and tried to punch them, but didn't even make a dent.</p>

            <p>Kandoth turned back to the eye. "Umm, can we please go now?"</p>

            <p>"Before you leave, would you like to fill out a survey on your experience with Knowbula? It'll put you in to win a 500 squirrel gift card!"</p>

            <p>"Maybe later," Pomeere grumbled.</p>

            <p>"Alrighty then! Enjoy your membership!"</p>

            <p>The doors opened. The human, the elf, and the ogre ran outside as the floating eyeball became a dull grey again.</p>
