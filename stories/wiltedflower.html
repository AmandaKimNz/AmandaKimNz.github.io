            <p><i>This is a quick story I wrote in a single evening (and then touched up later, of course!). To be honest, I don't really remember how I came up with the central joke, but once it was in my head I just had to put it to paper.</i></p>

            <p>“... Wilted Flower!” the man announced.</p>

            <p>The customer, a short chubby woman named Melissa, looked at the label. It had a skull and crossbones, with ‘Wilted Flower’ written in a gothic font below. “... Um, what is this? Why does it look so… Scary?”</p>

            <p>“A lovely question from a lovely lady such as yourself!” The man, whose name tag revealed him as ‘Stanley’, held up the perfume. “This isn’t some ordinary perfume that you’ll find at the bargain market, oh no! This all-natural scent will have lovers dropping to their knees faster than you’ll be dropping to the floor!”</p>

            <p>“I- What?”</p>

            <p>“Yessiree, this perfume has the unique property in that it’ll kill you instantly!” He grinned. “A never-before-seen innovation of those tired old scents!”</p>

            <p>“... You’re… You’re selling this?”</p>

            <p>“For only $10 a bottle, we’re practically giving it away! Never before has drop-dead perfection been so cheap!”</p>

            <p>“Yes, but, why would I want this?”</p>

            <p>“Wilted Flower has a unique, all-natural smell unlike any other! And did I mention it lasts over two weeks? The strongest on the market! One squirt can easily last you until your funeral!” He leaned in with a hand over his chest. “You wouldn’t want to smell like rotting flesh at your own funeral, would you?”</p>

            <p>Melissa thought about it. “... I suppose I wouldn’t…”</p>

            <p>“Then why not give it a go?” He held the bottle of Wilted Flower up to her face. “Only $10 a bottle! Not like you’ll need the money after buying this anyhow!”</p>

            <p>“I guess that makes sense… And it is all-natural…” She slipped a $10 bill out of her wallet and handed it to Stanley.</p>

            <p>He passed her the bottle. “Trust me, you’ll be hooked on this for as long as you live!”</p>

            <p>“I’d hope so.” Right there in the mall, she opened the bottle and gave herself a small puff. “Mmh… Wow, that is quite lovely,” were her last words before she collapsed to the ground.</p>

            <p>“You hear that, folks?” Stanley announced to the mall. “It is quite lovely! Why not get some for yourself as well?”</p>
