            <h1>Why Do I Write?</h1>

            <div class="pagelink"><a href="../index.html" class="button">Main</a> <a href="../aboutme.html" class="button">About Me</a> <a href="../works.html" class="button">Works</a> <a href="../blog.html" class="button">Blog</a></div>

            <p>It's a question that every creative gets asked at one point, whether they're asking themselves or someone else is asking them: Why do you do what you do?</p>

            <p>I feel like my answer isn't that interesting. "I enjoy it." Like... What else do I even say to that? When people ask why I write, they probably have something different in mind. I know there's many people out there who write as a means of self expression. Those who write to get their messages and morals out in the world. Even people who're just in it for the money. Those are the 'accepted' answers, but I feel like I don't really fit into that. I enjoy creating for the sake of it. I only create the sorts of things I do because I find them more interesting, not for any moral or anything.</p>

            <p>At least, nothing I'm consciously aware of. There's probably some deep-seated psychological thing that I'm venting through my work that I don't even know about. But as far as I'm aware (right now), I'm just writing for the sake of entertainment.</p>

            <p>Realistically speaking, most people would accept that as an answer. But for whatever reason, I've built this strawman in my head that <i>hates</i> the very idea of it. As if there's anyone out there who absolutely won't accept "fun" for an answer, and must keep all media deep and super meaningful. There's almost certainly someone out there who thinks like that, but I sure haven't met them.</p>

            <p>I can only guess that this idea crept into my mind because, even as a kid, I always preferred cartoons that were just weird and fun, like Chowder or Camp Lazlo. I also watched a <i>ton</i> of review channels on Youtube. A borderline unhealthy amount. And because anger sold really well back then, everyone was trying to imitate the AVGN or the Nostalgia Critic. Because that was my primary introduction to how "analysing media" worked, I grew up into a cynical snob. And because of that, I went from neutral to outright resentful of shows, games, and tropes that I personally didn't like.</p>

            <p>And a lot of those shows I didn't like were the "deep and meaningful" ones. I won't even say that's <i>why</i> I didn't like them, I think they were all just directed at people above my age range. And those types of shows always got amazing publicity online, so my inner hipster combined with the cynicism learned online created this hatred towards how everyone was "forcing unnecessary meaningfulness" into their works instead of making them "actually good".</p>

            <p>I won't act like I don't still kinda agree, but I like to think I've calmed down a lot more as I grew up. I'm more open to stories that are full of metaphors and lessons and whatnot. Heck, I like some of them. Hypnospace Outlaw is one of my favourite games of all time, not even <i>despite</i> how meaningful it was, but <i>because</i> of it. But ultimately, I still value the sense of raw fun. In my opinion, a text that's super fun but not very meaningful is still amazing, but a text that's super meaningful while not very fun is a failure. Of course, different people get different things out of their media. I can live with that.</p>

            <p>Right, the question. I write because I enjoy it, and I generally don't bother thinking deeper about it.</p>
