            <h1>Finding Motivation to Write</h1>

            <div class="pagelink"><a href="../index.html" class="button">Main</a> <a href="../aboutme.html" class="button">About Me</a> <a href="../works.html" class="button">Works</a> <a href="../blog.html" class="button">Blog</a></div>

            <p>Sometimes, I have a really great idea for a story, and I just sit down and throw it all onto a page. All's well and good. But most of the time, I either have no idea what to write, or I just keep finding myself distracted until the day is over and I have to sleep. And the older I get, the more I feel like I've been getting distracted. I used to be able to pump out three pages in an afternoon, but now I'm lucky to get one.</p>
            
            <p>I think some part of it is that I've been dealing with my own personal issues (which I won't go into here), and that's been killing my mood in general. And semi-related, but I'm in university as I'm writing this. In fact, that's <i>why</i> I'm writing this. It's work, and after a day of genuine work I really want to relax with video games or shows, not trying to force myself to write.</p>
            
            <p>It's not that I don't enjoy writing. Once I've started, I find it fun. It's just that "getting started" bit that's hard for me. It <i>sounds</i> like too much hard work given my limited free time and how much I've already done that day.</p>
            
            <p>One thing that's helped me is actually making writing work. Like, if I have a deadline (if it's for a friend, commission, or contest), I can write it no problem. It doesn't even feel too much like work, it just gives me that little bit of pressure I need.</p>
            
            <p>Another thing I've found recently is this thing called "Writing Sprints". It's a Discord bot (but I'm sure you could do it on your own as well) that will time you for 15-20 minutes, and you have to write as much as you can. In the end, you submit your word count. It doesn't really reward you with anything (outside of a "good job"), but I've found having that deadline helps me focus a lot. You won't believe how much more productive I became after finding out about those.</p>
            
            <p>But writing sprints are mostly effective for me because my other writing friends are able to join in. It becomes something of a social experience, despite none of us talking to each other during the sprint. I can't even explain why, it's just easier to write knowing someone else is writing alongside me on something completely unrelated.</p>
            
            <p>So, yeah. I have motivation issues, sprints are my best way to fight against that.</p>
